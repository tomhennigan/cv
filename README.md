CV Template
===========

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Disclaimer:** The fact that my CV is on GitHub (and that I am updating it) is
not an indication that I am looking for a new job. Seriously. If you are a
recruiter and contact me on here or LinkedIn I am not going to reply or connect
with you. **I am not looking for new opportunities.**

Hacking
-------

Content edits should be made to the `cv.md` file. The idea is that all content
will be changed here, and we use pandoc to transform the markdown CV betwen
formats.

Setup:

    docker pull pandoc/latex

Usage:

	./build_pdf.sh
