:   **Developer at DueDil**
:   Full stack engineer with a focus on back-end engineering and infrastructure.
    Integral part of team that designed and built DueDil's core distributed data
    processing infrastructure. Notable projects where I played a key role:
:   - Built an in-house framework for scheduling batch jobs for a tera-scale
      workload.
    - Designed and deployed a multi tenant, dynamic size data processing cluster
      (Jenkins, Hadoop, HDFS, Heritrix and Mesos)   orchestrated with Chef in
      Amazon EC2.
    - Implement the use of automated bidding on spot-instances for our batch
      workload in Amazon EC2 (allowing 10x the compute resource at the same
      price compared to non-spot).
    - Implemented a high performance bulk loading strategy for importing and
      indexing relational data in Postgres (one of   the major databases used by
      DueDil) affording a 10x speedup to validate a new dataset.
    - Implemented data warehouse on top of S3, including (custom) out of band
      garbage collection and configurable redundancy.
    - Built out a substantial number of data processing jobs (largely MapReduce
      and web crawling) in Python for processing and widening DueDil's
      tera-scale dataset.
    - Implemented a multi-threaded, multi-process and distributed (via Hadoop)
      web scraper (used for one year while we built tooling and functionality
      on top of Heritrix).

Summer 2011
:   **Software Engineer Intern at Google**
:   Worked in the Google Mobile Maps (GMM) team to design and implement an
