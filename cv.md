2012-2014
:   **Developer at DueDil**
:   Full stack engineer with a focus on back-end engineering and infrastructure.
    Integral part of team that designed and built DueDil's core distributed data
    processing infrastructure. Notable projects where I played a key role:
:   - Built an in-house framework for scheduling batch jobs for a tera-scale
      workload.
    - Designed and deployed a multi tenant, dynamic size data processing cluster
      (Jenkins, Hadoop, HDFS, Heritrix and Mesos)   orchestrated with Chef in
      Amazon EC2.
    - Implement the use of automated bidding on spot-instances for our batch
      workload in Amazon EC2 (allowing 10x the   compute resource at the same
      price compared to non-spot).
    - Implemented a high performance bulk loading strategy for importing and
      indexing relational data in Postgres (one of   the major databases used by
      DueDil) affording a 10x speedup to validate a new dataset.
    - Implemented data warehouse on top of S3, including (custom) out of band
      garbage collection and configurable redundancy.
    - Built out a substantial number of data processing jobs (largely MapReduce
      and web crawling) in Python for processing and widening DueDil's
      tera-scale dataset.
    - Implemented a multi-threaded, multi-process and distributed (via Hadoop)
      web scraper (used for one year while we built tooling and functionality
      on top of Heritirix).

    - Built non-emergency patient transport booking system (thetaxibooker.com)
      integrated with NHS CaMIS system used by multiple hospitals on the soutch
      coast.
    - Worked on front-end and back-end features for many other sites, in sectors
      such as recruitment (Escape The City), e-commerce (e.g. Trinacria Wines),
      parcel delivery (e.g. Parcel Monkey, PayPound Express), entertainment
      (e.g. We Love Your Songs).
    - Re-developed in-house CMS system used by 10+ contract developers,
      including functionality such as authentication, user management, content
      routing, mailing lists, content management (WYSIWIG) and logging.

    professional programmers from such a young age. The project had millions of 
    downloads (see below) and was very successful, however it has recently 
    ended due to Microsoft shutting down the MSN messenger service.

Key Skills
==========

Hadoop
:   I've been working with Hadoop for almost two years now. I have in depth 
    experience with Hadoop version 0.20.2 as well as 1.0.3. I also have
    extensive experience with the [MrJob](https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob)
    framework, and have contributed some patches back to the project. I've also
    worked on the operations side of Hadoop, working with an in house cluster,
    as well as using EMR from Amazon.

Java
:   I learnt Java whilst at university and attained over 90% in the modules 
    associated with Java programming as well as the Java based coursework for
    the data structures and algorithms module. I worked almost exclusively in
    Java whilst at Google.

Python
:   My work at DueDil has been almost exclusively in Python. I've worked mainly 
    with Python 2.7, however I have some exposure to Python 3, as well as the 
    challenges faced by software developed for 2.7 to support 3 as well.

C
:   I taught myself C at the age of 13. C has always been a passion of mine, 
    however I've not written any C professionally for anything other than small 
    internal tools. One of the more challenging C projects I've worked on was my 
    own project to write an emulator for the
    [Motorola 6803 microprocessor](https://github.com/tomhennigan/6803).

Chef
:   The infrastructure at DueDil is managed entirely by Chef. I help to run a
    chef managed Hadoop cluster and surrounding infrastructure, as well as
    writing cookbooks for other services we require.

Postgres
:   I have two years experience working with Postgres. One interesting use case
    that I helped develop was a Postgres server tuned to bulk load hundreds of
    gigabytes per evening as well as deliver read performance in excess of 100k
    transactions per second at peak times

MySQL
:   I've worked with MySQL (version 5) as an application developer and system 
    administrator. I've setup MySQL server in a shared hosting environment as
    well as developed applications on top of existing MySQL deployments.

Git
:   My personal favourite version control system is Git (I also have experience 
    working with SVN, CVS and Perforce.). I've found Git to be the best tool for 
    the job in most cases whilst developing personal, professional and open
    source  code. I've worked with (and enjoy) the 
    [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
    branching model and have a fair amount of experience with 
    [GitHub](https://github.com).

AWS
:   I have a lot of experience working with Amazon's elastic compute cloud (EC2) 
    and simple storage service (S3). I've managed 100s of machines in EC2
    pushing hundreds of gigabytes of data to and from S3 on a regular basis.
